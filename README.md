A series of procedurally generated posters done as apart of "Graphic Design Browser Tools", a class from Type@Cooper.

The visual inspiration for this project can be found [here](https://www.are.na/calcifer-chang/floral-poster-series). The current version can be found [here](https://calciferchang.github.io/flower-poster-series/), hosted with github pages. It eventually will have a more permanent home, similar to [poster.consuming.now](https://poster.consuming.now)
